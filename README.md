## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern, full-stack architecture:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
  - **React Router**: For client-side routing and navigation.
  - **Axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
  - **Chart.js**: For creating beautiful and interactive charts.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building the server.
  - **Express**: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
  - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database.
  - **Sequelize**: A modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
  - **Passport.js**: For handling user authentication strategies (Google OAuth and local).

- **Deployment**:
  - **Frontend**: Hosted on **Netlify** for continuous deployment and global CDN.
  - **Backend**: Hosted on **Render** for managing the Node.js server and PostgreSQL database.
  - **Monitoring**: Kept active with **Uptime Robot** to prevent the free-tier backend from sleeping.

## ðŸš€ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, you will need Node.js and a PostgreSQL database.

### 1. Backend Server (`/server`)

1.  **Navigate to the `server` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create a `.env` file** in the `server` root and add the following variables:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
    COOKIE_KEY=a_long_random_secret_string
    ```
4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend will be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

### 2. Frontend Client (`/client`)
